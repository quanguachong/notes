# Mastering Issues

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.

## filter and categorize issues

1. Milestones: Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period.

2. Labels：Labels are a great way to organize different types of issues. Issues can have as many labels as you want, and you can filter by one or many labels at once.

3. Assignees：Each issue can have an assignee — one person that’s responsible for moving the issue forward.
