# Document is important

Good documentation is key to the success of any project. Making documentation accessible enables people to learn about a project; making it easy to update ensures that documentation stays relevant.

Two common ways to document a project are README files and wikis:

* README files are a quick and simple way for other users to learn more about your work.
* Wikis on GitHub help you present in-depth information about your project in a useful way.

## Creating your README

## Formatting your README

READMEs generally follow one format in order to immediately orient developers to the most important aspects of your project.

* **Project name:**

* **Description**:A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.
* **Table of Contents**:Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.
* **installation**
* **Usage**:The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
* **Contributing**
* **Credits**:Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.
* **License**

**Notes**:Your README should contain only the necessary information for developers to get started using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is best suited for wikis, outlined below.
